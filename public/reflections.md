## 1. List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
 1.Variable Decleration: JavaScript has 3 types of variables, namely var, let, and const. Var is what you use to declare and create a new variable. Let is similar to var, however unlike var, it cannot be redeclared. The final type is const, which is a constant value that is read-only and cannot be redeclared.
 2.JavaScript Basic Statements: There are multiple kinds of JavaScript statements. One example is the alert() statement where your code will appear in a alert box. Another example is an output statement called document.write() and an input statement called a prompt box.
 3. Arithmetic Operators
There are 7 types of arithmetic operators. First, we have the usual, addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), and division(/). We also have modulus(%) which gives us the remainder, increment (++) which adds one to the operand, and decrement (--) which subtracts one from the operand.
 4. Comparison Operators
There are 5 types of comparison operators. First, we have equal(==) that checks if 2 values are equal or not. We have not equa;(!=) which is true when 2 values are not equal. There is greater than(>) and less than(<) which checks whether the values on the left side are greater than or less than the values on the right. Lastly, we have greater than or equal to(>=) which checks if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the one on the right.
 5. Logical Operators
We have AND (&&) which returns true if both operands are true and the opposite if they are false. There is OR(||) which returns false if both operands are false, and otherwise, it will return true. Lastly, NOT (!) which negates the result of the whole statement.

## 2. List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed. 
1. For loop
2. Do While
3. Switch Statement
4. For in Loop
5. Debugging


## 3. Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
1. Read LGs, resource materials online/in kHub: I will read the LGs of the lessons we will discuss before hand so I will be prepared and more confident.
2. Practice: Through practicing coding using different websites/online resources, coding in quizzes/exercises/exas will be way easier.
3. If the earlier methods aren't working, I will ask help from classmates and teachers to better understand to topi.


## 4. In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
Effective:
1. Portfolio
The portfolio was extremely effective and fun to do. It was a good introduction to our first lesson and was a way for us to understand the basics of VSCode and HTML.
2. Final Exam (Part 1)
The objective partof the Final Exam was a good summary of everything we learned this quarter. It was able to effectively challenge our understanding of the lessons we learned.
Ineffective:
3. 7th Graded Exercise
The 7th Graded Exercise was different from most of our usual exercises. I was surprised so it was harder for me to do.
4. Speed Exercise
The Speed Exercise wasn't neccessarily ineffective, but for me it was. This is because for exercises, I tend to take a longer time. The Speed Exercise was very fast-paced and a bit pressuring.
